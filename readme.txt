I was struck by starving people when I watched TV.Meanwhile,I think stellaris is so easy than my expectation.So with inspired by other mods,I created a hungry world that pops are lacking in food.You need keep balance between your pop and the exploration in space.Good luck!

This mod will increase difficulty,so dont use this mod when you are beginning.
Recommand hard or insane game when use this mod.ONLY WORKS WITH NEW FILES!

CURRENT FEATURES:
 1.New items:
  1)1x strategic resource "Luxury Food"
  2)5x2 spaceport modules for producing "Luxury Food" from food(or from food to "Luxury Food"),and will lose a small amount of food when use lower modules.
  3)1x factory for AI so that it will get enough "Luxury Food" to develop;
  4)5x technologies to research spaceport modules.

 2.Adjusting
  1)Normal building above Lv.2 or special building need "Luxury Food" to maintain the operation,so do the specific type of station in space.Because the more abilities you have,the more salary you want of course;
  2)Pop will improve technology(a bit though).(dont change the cost of colonies);
  3)You hardly find food on ramdom planet except your homeworld;
  4)The chance of getting planet modifiers will be increased.And all of planet modifiers now have double-edged(eg.+food -energy);
  5)starvation like death penalty will destory this planet shortly ,and stop pop producing any resource;

Features will add:(before v1.0)
  1)Random events to control in quantity of resources,especially in late game;
  2)Random natural disasters.
  3)Adjust balance(cost,produced resources,and required resources mostly at this stage);
  4)support languages,do my best(Japanese forecast).

Its will be completed within 2 weeks I expect,and will be published as v1.0.
For balance,I wont let luxury food be traded ,even if it's easy to complete.

Compatibility:
  1)Only works with new files.
  2)This mod is compatible with mods which adjust functions like warfare system,map,governance. Dont use mods which have same functions together pls.
